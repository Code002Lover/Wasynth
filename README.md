This is a WIP (read: absolutely not ready for serious work) tool for translating WebAssembly into Lua. Support is specifically for LuaJIT, with the secondary objective being Lua 5.4 and Roblox's Luau.

The instructions are minimal; run the program as `program <edition> <file...>` to generate the translations into stdout. Editions currently supported are `LuaJIT` and `Luau`.
